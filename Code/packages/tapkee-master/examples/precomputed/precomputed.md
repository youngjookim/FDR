In this example the usage of precomputed distance matrix callback is considered.
Just like in the minimal example, distances are just absolute values of differences
between indices and the Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) algorithm is used 
(in its classic metric formulation). The difference lies in the fact that 
distance matrix is used with no data explicitly formed. The output of the example
coincides with the output of the minimal example and presents a range 
of real values from -49.5 to 49.5.
