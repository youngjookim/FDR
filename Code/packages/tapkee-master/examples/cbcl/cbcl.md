In this example we embed high-dimensional data which is a set 
of synthesized images of faces (with size 200 x 200). The 
Local Tangent Space Alignment method is used to embed the 
data to 2d euclidean space. It is worth to note that 
the images set considered in this example has intrinsic 
dimensionality of 2 which is clearly 'catched' by the algorithm.
Credit is hereby given to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology 
and to the Center for Biological and Computational Learning 
for providing the database of facial images.
