In this example MNIST digits represented by 28 x 28 images are embedded
using the Barnes-Hut-SNE method. The original data is represented by
784 dimensional vectors (each pixel intensity is a feature). The 
dimension reduction method used in this example attempts to 
group vectors which represent the same digit (in an unsupervised manner 
- no labels are provided) in 2d space.
