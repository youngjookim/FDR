Locality Preserving Projections
-------------------------------

The Locality Preserving Projections algorithm can be viewed as a linear approximation of the 
Laplacian Eigenmaps algorithm. It reproduces first two steps of the Laplacian Eigenmaps and 
the difference lies in the step 3. To obtain $ t $ features (coordinates) of embedded vectors 
LPP solves the partial generalized eigenproblem 
$$ R (D-W) R^{T} f = \lambda R D R^{T} f, $$
where $ R $ contains all feature vectors row-wise, for smallest eigenvalues
$ \lambda\_1, \dots, \lambda\_t, \lambda\_{t+1} $ and its corresponding 
eigenvectors $ f\_1, \dots, f\_t, f\_{t+1} $. Drop the smallest eigenvalue $ \lambda\_1 \sim 0 $ 
(with the corresponding eigenvector) and form embedding matrix such that $i$-th coordinate 
($ i=1,\dots,N $) of $j$-th eigenvector ($ j=1,\dots,t$ ) corresponds to 
$j$-th coordinate of projected $i$-th vector.
