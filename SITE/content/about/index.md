Sharpened dimensionality reduction (SDR) sharpens the original data before dimensionality reduction to create visually segregrated sample clusters, which is targeted for user-guided labeling.

## Abstract
One of the largest challenges of using dimensionality reduction (DR) on large, high-dimensional data sets is to distinguish the underlying high-dimensional data clusters in a 2D projection. We address this problem by first sharpening the clusters in the data prior to the DR step using Local Gradient Clustering (LGC). We then project the sharpened data by a user-selected DR method. The sharpening step helps this method to preserve cluster separation more easily in the resulting 2D projection. With our method, end-users can label each distinct cluster to further analyze an otherwise unlabeled data set. Our `High-Dimensional Sharpened DR' (HD-SDR) method, tested on both synthetic and real-world data sets, is favorable to DR methods with poor cluster separation and yields a better visual cluster separation than these DR methods with no sharpening. We show that our method achieves good quality (measured by quality metrics) and scales computationally well with large high-dimensional data. We further apply HD-SDR on a recent astronomical catalog.
