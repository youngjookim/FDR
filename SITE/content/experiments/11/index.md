(a) Wall-clock timing of LGC, for different number of observations along the x-axis and varying dimensions up to 20D. (b) Wall-clock time measurement of LGC on 10K (20D) data also used in (a), using different learning rates &alpha;. We note that the wall-clock time increases with increasing &alpha; and depends heavily on the number of dimensions.
