Comparison of DR and HD-SDR on HAR data with dimensions pre-selected using PCA as in Figure 12. Note that the separation of clusters is slightly improved for HD-SDR as compared with DR (although subclusters are visually less separable). We note that nearly all samples in cluster (1) are from the lying movement, cluster (2) mostly includes samples from static postures (standing and sitting), and cluster (3) mostly includes samples from the three dynamic activities.
