Effects of different parameters using 2D non-Gaussian (log-normal, &mu;=0, and &sigma;=1) data with 10K observations. Note that the effects of the parameters are similar to those of Figure 1. However, LGC with too large values of T and &alpha; is prone to outliers (long tails), as shown in (d) and (l), but this problem can be solved by setting a larger value of k.
