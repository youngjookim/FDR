Comparison of neighborhood hit (Qh) for sharpened data and original data of the five different types of synthetic data used in Figure 3. For all synthetic data sets, Qh is always higher for the sharpened data as compared with the original data. We also note that Qh for sharpened data is higher when clusters are more separated (&alpha;=0.04 compared with &alpha;=0.01).
