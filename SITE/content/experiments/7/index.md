Comparison of neighborhood hit (Qh) for DR and HD-SDR of the five different types of synthetic data used for Figure 3. Note that St-SNE, t-SNE, and SLMDS yield high Qh values near one for (a)--(c) and (e), which suggests that the corresponding labels of the k-size neighborhoods are well-preserved for HD-SDR. However, HD-SDR for sub-clustered data produces lower Qh compared with DR, as shown in (d), and this can be seen visually in Figure 3(a)--(d). More results including Qt, Qc, and Qj for the five synthetic data sets can be found in the supplemental materials.
