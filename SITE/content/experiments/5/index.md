Results of four neighborhood-based quality metrics for Banknote data: Neighborhood hit (Q<sub>h</sub>), Trustworthiness (Q<sub>t</sub>), Continuity (Q<sub>c</sub>), and Jaccard set distance (Q<sub>j</sub>). Note that Q<sub>h</sub> is consistent with results from Figure 3 and best represents the visual cluster separation, whereas Q<sub>t</sub>, Q<sub>c</sub>, and Q<sub>j</sub> suggest the opposite. Note that Q<sub>t</sub>, Q<sub>c</sub>, and Q<sub>j</sub> do not consider class label information. More results including Q<sub>t</sub>, Q<sub>c</sub>, and Q<sub>j</sub> for the five synthetic data sets can be found in the supplemental materials.
