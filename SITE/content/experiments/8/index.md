The neighborhood hit (Qh) metric for DR and HD-SDR using labeled real-world data sets with different values of k. We note that Qh is lower for St-SNE than for t-SNE for most values of k in (b)-(d). However for LMDS, which produces a weaker separation of clusters than t-SNE, SLMDS produces a higher value of Qh compared with LMDS for all data sets.
