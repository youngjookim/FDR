All contents from https://youngjookim.github.io/sdr/ were submitted to IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VISUALIZATION AND COMPUTER GRAPHICS.

This video was made based on the results from [this figure](https://youngjookim.github.io/sdr/experiments/10/).

Top-left plot shows the SLMDS projection of the GALAH DR2 sample, where clusters are visually labeled by one of us (SCT). The labeled clusters in SLMDS help domain experts to further analyze the data as follows. The bottom-left plot shows the Tinsley diagram for the GALAH DR2 sample, showing the abundance of magnesium as a function of the iron abundance, used to interpret the origin and location of Milky Way stars. This diagram suggests to our domain-expert (SCT) that stars in Class 1 belong to the Milky Way's ``thin disk'', while those in Classes 2 and 4 appear to belong to the Milky Way's ``metal-rich thick disk'' and ``metal-poor thick disk'', respectively, and stars in Class 3 appear to belong to the Milky Way's ``stellar halo''. The second bottom-left plot shows the barium abundance of the stars as a function of their iron abundance, a tracer of a different nucleosynthetic process (the slow-neutron-capture, ``s-'', process). Stars in Class 3 have strongly different barium abundances for their low iron content. These may be ``metal-poor barium stars'', which arise from binary star interactions. The same analysis for St-SNE and SUMAP are shown in the supplemental results, while the clusters in SRP Figure 9(b) are not easily separated, thus excluded.
