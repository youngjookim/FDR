Analysis of GALAH DR2 sample using St-SNE and SUMAP projections (top row), where clusters are visually labeled by one of us (SCT) and the Tinsley diagrams [77] for the GALAH DR2 sample (bottom row), showing the abundance of magnesium and Barium as a function of the iron abundance, used to interpret the origin and location of Milky Way stars. Note that the clusters in SRP are not easily separated, thus excluded.
